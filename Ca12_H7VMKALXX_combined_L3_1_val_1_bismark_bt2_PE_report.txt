Bismark report for: Result/Ca12/CleanData/Ca12_H7VMKALXX_combined_L3_1_val_1.fq.gz and Result/Ca12/CleanData/Ca12_H7VMKALXX_combined_L3_2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.16.3)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /nas2/Project/AmpliconBS/batch7_ZGM_human_20samples/Ref_Gene/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,-50,-0.8 --rdg 1,1 --rfg 1,1 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	515773
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	458804
Mapping efficiency:	89.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	21190
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	35779
